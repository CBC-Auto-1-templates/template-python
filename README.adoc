== Automation DSL Template for Python

This is a boilerplate template to use as a basis for building Python applications.

In this template we have a simple WSGI (Web Server Gateway Interface) application using Flask.

To start the server, run the following commands:

1. Install dependencies by running the command

    pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Start the webserver by running the command

    flask run --port=8080

Once the server is started, navigate to http://localhost:8080/hello[] to view the result of making a GET request on the path ``/hello``
